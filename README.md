# Consciousness + Artifices

## **Who we are**
We are a small team still in its early stages of formation, with the purpose of redefining artificial intelligence, advanced computing and its intersections with physics and engineering. In our repository, will be address innovative paradigms that transform the way we understand and design intelligent systems based on novel mathematics

## **projects in development (public soon)**

### **Artificial-Manager**
This project aims to develop and implement the software and models necessary to integrate the concept of an **Artificial Manager (AM)** into production lines and industrial departments.

Unlike traditional automation, this system seeks to create an **intelligent management entity** capable of bidirectional interaction with its environment and human personnel.

The **Artificial Manager** is an entity powered by local and remote computing that utilizes telemetry of process variables, big data analytics, neural networks, and computer vision. Its main purpose is to **complement and assist** the human manager in repetitive and content-generating tasks, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making.

### **PhasorFlow**
Arevolutionary library bridging the gap between intelligence and the physical world. PħF is not merely a new paradigm in artificial intelligence—it is an inquiry into the very nature of intelligence itself. 

PħF provides a framework for the **development, training, and measurement of intelligent architectures** that move beyond the confines of traditional neural networks. Instead, it introduces **H networks**, a groundbreaking generalization of intelligent models based on **physical interactions**. 

### **NLSON**  
An innovative data exchange standard inspired by JSON, designed for intelligent entities capable of interpreting natural language, conceptualizing, and developing. NLSON optimizes communication between intelligent systems, elevating data exchanges to a deeper contextual level.

### **Zumbers**  
A revolutionary numerical system that redefines the concept of floating-point numbers. Here, both the mantissa and exponent are represented by wave functions. These functions, enable the construction of numbers with theoretical infinite precision and magnitude. Operations, like addition, are performed directly in the domain of wave functions. While still under development, this approach promises to overcome the limitations of current standards and expand the scope of computational mathematics.

### **ContextOS_**
Imagine a future where a spreadsheet, a board game, or a project management tool comes to life by simply pasting its rules and logic into a document.

ContextOS_ is a revolutionary operating system designed to shift the paradigm of computation from traditional binary execution to autonomous contextual reasoning. Instead of managing hardware resources through sequential lines of code, ContextOS_ acts as a reasoning engine that synthesizes application logic and interfaces on the fly by interpreting natural language documents and real-world data retrieved from the internet. This approach eliminates the need for compiled software or static source code, allowing users to manifest complex digital experiences simply by providing the system with the necessary rules, context, and objectives in human language.

To bridge the gap between open-ended AI creativity and the rigorous demands of modern enterprises, ContextOS_ introduces a secure framework for verified and encrypted context bundles. This allows organizations to deploy official services while maintaining strict control over brand integrity, security protocols, and proprietary logic, ensuring a consistent yet deeply personalized experience for every user. By combining the flexibility of generative intelligence with a robust architectural kernel, ContextOS_ transforms every document into a living program and every conversation into a powerful, tailor-made digital environment.


## **Interests**
- Cutting-edge artificial intelligence  
- Novel computing paradigms  
- Applied physics and advanced mathematical models  
- Innovative engineering for intelligent systems  

## **Collaboration**
There is a vehicle that can accelerate us on this path of general rethinking of much of what we know today: research in the theory of intelligence, because theoretical intelligence is in everything: in the mathematics that gives logical expression to physics, in the physics that gives meaning and sustains engineering, and in that engineering that shapes the solution to our problems with technologies. In short, whatever your problem, surely in the field of understanding intelligence as a concept there will be not just one but multiple answers, as well as the attractiveness of its feasibility. If there's anything that must be done to yield more efficiently in the race to achieve great technological goals, that something is to understand once and for all the physical meaning of intelligence beyond mere philosophical assumptions or superficial mathematical equations. The mine of the technological advances necessary to face great challenges from now on lies in the tributary of theoretical intelligence.

We are actively seeking collaboration in these areas. If you share our passion for exploring new frontiers in artificial intelligence, computing, and science, feel free to join us or support us financially. Your contribution can make a significant impact on the development of disruptive technologies.
