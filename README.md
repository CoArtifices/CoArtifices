# Consciousness + Artifices

## **Who we are**
We are a small team still in its early stages of formation, with the purpose of redefining artificial intelligence, advanced computing and its intersections with physics and engineering. In our repository, will be address innovative paradigms that transform the way we understand and design intelligent systems based on novel mathematics

## **projects in development (public soon)**
### **PhasorFlow**
Arevolutionary library bridging the gap between intelligence and the physical world. PħF is not merely a new paradigm in artificial intelligence—it is an inquiry into the very nature of intelligence itself. 

PħF provides a framework for the **development, training, and measurement of intelligent architectures** that move beyond the confines of traditional neural networks. Instead, it introduces **H networks**, a groundbreaking generalization of intelligent models based on **wave propagation** and **physical interactions**. This paradigm draws from the principles of phasorial physics, replacing neuron-inspired computation with architectures that are inherently tied to physical laws and interactions.

### **NLSON**  
An innovative data exchange standard inspired by JSON, designed for intelligent entities capable of interpreting natural language, conceptualizing, and developing. NLSON optimizes communication between intelligent systems, elevating data exchanges to a deeper contextual level.

### **Fumbers**  
A revolutionary numerical system that redefines the concept of floating-point numbers. Here, both the mantissa and exponent are represented by wave functions. These functions, defined by their cycles, enable the construction of numbers with theoretical infinite precision and magnitude. Operations, like addition, are performed directly in the domain of wave functions. While still under development, this approach promises to overcome the limitations of current standards and expand the scope of computational mathematics.

## **Interests**
- Cutting-edge artificial intelligence  
- Novel computing paradigms  
- Applied physics and advanced mathematical models  
- Innovative engineering for intelligent systems  

## **Collaboration**
There is a vehicle that can accelerate us on this path of general rethinking of much of what we know today: research in the theory of intelligence, because theoretical intelligence is in everything: in the mathematics that gives logical expression to physics, in the physics that gives meaning and sustains engineering, and in that engineering that shapes the solution to our problems with technologies. In short, whatever your problem, surely in the field of understanding intelligence as a concept there will be not just one but multiple answers, as well as the attractiveness of its feasibility. If there's anything that must be done to yield more efficiently in the race to achieve great technological goals, that something is to understand once and for all the physical meaning of intelligence beyond mere philosophical assumptions or superficial mathematical equations. The mine of the technological advances necessary to face great challenges from now on lies in the tributary of theoretical intelligence.

We are actively seeking collaboration in these areas. If you share our passion for exploring new frontiers in artificial intelligence, computing, and science, feel free to join us or support us financially. Your contribution can make a significant impact on the development of disruptive technologies.
